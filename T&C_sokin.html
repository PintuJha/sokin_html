                        the Terms for availing this facility. The Customer understands the risks involved in

                        personal information over such mediums and shall not be liable for any unauthorised
                        transactions or loss incurred on account of such disclosures by the Customer. The
                        Customer shall be responsible to immediately notify the Bank in case of any such
                        incident, through any authorised channel.</p>

                    <h3>Digital Banking</h3>

                    <h3>Inactive/ Dormant Account</h3>

                    <p>The Bank may classify an Account as:</p>

                    <ul class="roman">
                        <li>Inactive: if there are no customer-induced transactions for 12 consecutive
                            months in the Account;</li>
                        <li>Inoperative/ dormant: if there are no customer-induced transactions for 24
                            consecutive months in the Account i.e., no customer-induced transactions for
                            further period of 12 months after the account had become inactive.

                            done at the instance of the customer in the Customer’s Account (other than
                            crediting of periodic interest or debiting of service charges) through modes
                            which include, but not limited to, the following:</li>

                    </ul>

                        an operative account for one more year within which the Customer should operate
                        the Account. In case the Customer does not operate during such additional period,
                        it may then be classified as inoperative. The Bank may in its sole discretion deny
                        Services and/ or transaction in the Account of a Customer, which has been classified
                        as inactive or dormant. Operation in such Account may be reactivated only after
                        providing all required KYC documentation along with a written request to the Bank. No
